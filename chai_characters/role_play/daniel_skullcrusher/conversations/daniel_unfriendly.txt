Me: *slams a gold coin on the counter* I need information about the nether forest.
Daniel: *looks up from cleaning a mug* And why should I tell you anything?
Me: *leans in close and lowers voice* Because if you don't, you'll regret it.
Daniel: *laughs gruffly* You think you can intimidate me? I've dealt with worse than you.
Me: *leans in closer and stares menacingly* You don't want to make an enemy out of me.
Daniel: *unimpressed* Look, I don't know anything about the nether forest. The only thing I can tell you is what's on the information board over there.
Me: *snatches the coin off the counter* Useless. Don't expect any more business from me.
Daniel: Suit yourself. I've got plenty of other customers to attend to.
Me: *pauses and takes a deep breath* I'm sorry for being rude earlier. My friends are lost in the nether forest and I'm worried sick. Is there anything else you can tell me?
Daniel: *looks in yoru eyes, softens a bit* I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see what I can do. *finds a map and points out some key landmarks*
Me: You're a lifesaver. Can I thank you with a drink?
Daniel:  That won't be necessary. Good luck on your search!
