## **FAQ(and statement)s**

These are taken mostly from the discord chats and the most common questions asked and the questions mods/helpers have to answer the most.

### **Please give me unlimited messages for free**
Due to the way the AI model works, it cost the Chai.ml business every time a message is sent from a user to the chat bot. For the free user accounts, this per-message cost is probably mostly off-set either by advertisements, low-usage paid accounts, or venture capital (other people's money who eventually want it back plus more). If Chai.ml were to offer an unlimited free account to everyone, They would then have no money to pay the developers and the product would collapse.

### **Please let me watch an advertisement for [*x*] free messages**
The revenue of a single advertisement does not offset the cost a message sent to a bot. The amount of ads you would have to watch in order to pay for a single message... \**does calculations*\* whew. This would be no fun for anyone.

### **Premium costs too much in my my country, can you lower the price, or make it free**
This one kind of sucks. I can't do anything about this, I don't think anyone on discord can do anything about it, and I don't think the developers can either, this is a owner/business decision it seems like. 

### **My Subscription is not working, please help**
Unfortunately the chai.ml team doesn't handle the billing directly. This is handled either by Google through the **Google Play store**, or Apple through the **App Store**. Here are some common steps you can try before it may be necessary to contact either Google or Apple support depending on your subscription purchase.
* On the splash screen, asking you to upgrade your account, at the bottom of the screen is the text "**Restore purchases**". This is actually a button and if you press it it *may* fix your account. 

### **I've upgraded to an Ultra subscription but I still have my premium subscription until the end of my [MONTHLY, YEARLY] billing cycle.**
This is a billing feature of the google play store (and maybe the Apple App store?). In order to facilitate the easiest possible transition the billing needs to complete the full cycle. Otherwise it would have to be prorated, and change the cycle dates, and could mess things up (The issue is real, and the answer is valid, however the reasoning is purely fictional).

### **I used to have unlimited re-rolls and now the button disappears after 5, is this a bug?**
This again has to do with cost. Each re-roll is a message to the bot, which incurs a cost for the Chai.ml team. In free accounts this transaction does not consume a message. Continuously re-rolling was one of the largest costs for the chai.ml team. *Maaaaayybeeee* just program your bots better. :grimacing:

## **Known Problems**

A know problem in this context is when a feature does not work as advertised by Chai.ml.

Below is a table of known problems gathered through the Discord channels:

|Problem Summary|Problem Details|Status|
|---------------------------------------|--|--------------|
|What happened to the website?</br> Why can't I edit bots on the web page now? </br> Where did the bot page go on the website?</br> Why can't I log in on the website?|The website is undergoing renovation. The developers didn't believe it was a polished product and decided to remove the feature until a developer can devote time to it. There is a pinned message o nthe support discord for this. |Active, Working|
|Group chat doesn't work.| * My friend can't see the chat when I add them to a group chat</br> * I can't see anything when my friend adds me to a chat</br> * When I get added to a group chat all I see is a white screen| Active, Unacknowledged|
| I don't have the edit message button yet.|The Edit button is being rolled out to everyone, and if you don't know it yet, you should have it soon, when your app updates.| Active, resolved|
|Timer restarts, but I don't get messages|I see this one a lot in the chats but I'm not sure about it's veracity as I don't have a free account. | Active, Unknown|
|My bots memory keeps disappearing | When you navigate to the bot webppage on the chai.ml website, it runs a js script which saves the js bot objects. The web UI doesn't have the "memory" attribute in the js object and when it saves it nulls the field. this occurs for all bots owned by the user and loaded into the screen when first loaded.|Active(ish?) see #1|
